  <h1>Bluebird</h1>
  <p>Although I completed this work two years ago, the Bluebird design language project completely changed my experience at Twitter.</p>

  <p>My manager, now the Director of our studio, knew I had some free time, and challenged me to think critically about how Twitter should look and feel based on the utility it provides to the world.</p>

  <p>We collaborated on writing design principles, and I created many examples that were paired with the writing to inspire our studio to create new experiences.</p>

  <p>The results of the project were indirect but significant: members of the larger design team incorporated many ideas from the project into their daily work, and the project continues to challenge us to push the design language of Twitter forward whenever we can.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%201.png">
  <p class="caption">I explored different ways to reduce the prominance of our navigation, and larger footprints for text and media.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We reserved applying significant amounts of color for important moments, such as messaging and temporary and actionable interfaces.</p>

  <p class="caption">An example of user-defined color. Providing additional ways for the diverse personalities on Twitter to express themselves in public continues to fascinate me.</p>

  <h1>Color palette</h1>
  <p>One practical project that emerged from the Bluebird design language work was updating our color palette.</p>

  <p>After exploring ways to improve Twitter visually, we realized that updates to our palette were easy to ship and would immediately make an impact on how the product felt.</p>

  <p>A more vibrant palette helped us avoid making the interface feel too sterile as we reduced the prominence of our navigation.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/primary%20palete.png">
  <p class="caption">The latest iteration of our palette has two tones for each primary color. This gives us the flexibility to combine the two tones when layering benefits an experience, and also lets us choose a light or dark version of a color based on subject we are designing for.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/extended.png">
  <p class="caption">After the initial palette was created, we began to work with illustrators and content curators, so the need for a more extensive palette emerged.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/color.png">
  <p class="caption">As part of a larger system of materials for the studio, I maintained a small site that helped coworkers apply color to their work.</p>

  <p>Another aspect of our color palette that I worked on was Night mode. Night mode is a highly requested feature on Twitter, and a theming project I worked on during a Hackweek gave us a solid foundation to create Night mode from.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">All background colors are based on our primary blue hue, to prevent Night mode from feeling stark, and to tie it to our existing palette.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20examples.png">
  <p class="caption">Night mode is accessible on Android by opening our navigation drawer. Future plans include an automatic on/off setting based on time of day.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20theming.png">
  <p class="caption">A sample of a Hackweek project I worked on called Prism. The project provided sets of dark and light themes, and the work provided the technical foundation for Night mode.</p>

  <h1>Navigation</h1>
  <p>As the amount of features on Twitter expanded, a need for a team dedicated to navigation emerged. A coworker and I collaborated on our first navigation project, which was focused on proposing different navigation structures to help leadership evaluate how to add new features.

  <p>All design work throughout this project was kept low in fidelity to focus on the structure we were changing, and to keep the process open to ideas from teams impacted by any navigation change.</p>

  <p>The initial work resulted in the company deciding to consolidate several teams to work on content discovery together.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%201.png">
  <p class="caption">An exploration that proposes a single space to discover people and content.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We also explored ways to consolidate activity directed towards a person. This example consolidates direct messages and notifications.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%203.png">
  <p class="caption">This example consolidated all of our features into three destinations. The goal was to distinguish content that is highly personal (profiles and settings) from more public content, like the Timeline and search.</p>

  <p>While reviewing our progress, Jack Dorsey asked us to think about a Twitter experience that was centered around the Timeline with less distractions. We were excited about the prospect of a significantly less complicated and more iconic experience, so we briefly explored ways to simplify the interface even more dramatically.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%201.png">
  <p class="caption">We explored many examples like these, that reduced the perceived footprint of our navigation, to make more room for content.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%202.jpg">
  <p class="caption">We also explored how to make Twitter feel less complicated by making areas that surround the Timeline feel temporary and ancillary.</p>

  <h1>Dash</h1>
  <p>Originally a Hackweek project, Dash is now a funded effort to create a space for navigation related to personalization.</p>

  <p>I designed an easy to access space for Night mode, account switching, settings, and user profile controls.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash.png">
  <p class="caption">The drawer opens either by tapping on your avatar in our tab bar, or by edge swiping left anywhere within Twitter.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">Because the space is for personal content, I explored a color palette based on a person&#8217;s time of day.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied.png">
  <p class="caption">The morning and afternoon colors for the drawer.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied%202.png">
  <p class="caption">The evening colors for the drawer.</p>

  <h1>Conversations</h1>
  <p>Being able to understand a conversation on Twitter is currently very difficult. We do not have a discoverable destination to see replies, and do not distinguish replies from the Tweets they are in reply to.</p>

  <p class="caption">An exploration of a place to view replies to a Tweet, where you enter the conversation at the bottom, to show the most recent replies.</p>
