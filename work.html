  <h1>Bluebird</h1>
  <p>Although this project happened two years ago, the Bluebird design language project completely changed my experience on the design team at Twitter.</p>

  <p>My manager, now the Director of our studio, knew I had some free time, and challenged me to think critically about how Twitter should look and feel based on the utility it provides to the world.</p>

  <p>We collaborated on writing design principles and usage ideas, and I created many examples that were paired with our writing to inspire our studio to create new and exciting experiences.</p>

  <p>The results of the project were indirect but significant: members of the larger design team incorporated many ideas from the project into their daily work, and the project continues to challenge us to push the design language of Twitter forward whenever we can.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%201.png">
  <p class="caption">We explored different ways of reducing the prominence of our navigation, how to incorporate user-defined color, and larger typography and media.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We reserved applying significant amounts of color for important moments, such as messaging and temporary and actionable interfaces.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%203.png">
  <p class="caption">An example of how we could apply user-defined color. Providing additional ways for the diverse personalities on Twitter to express themselves in public continues to fascinate me.</p>

  <h1>Color palette</h1>
  <p>One practical project that emerged from the Bluebird design language project was updating our color palette.</p>

  <p>After exploring ways to improve Twitter visually, we realized that updates to our palette were easy to ship and would immediately make an impact on how the product felt.</p>

  <p>A more vibrant palette helped us avoid making the interface feel too sterile as we reduced the visual presence of our navigation.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/primary%20palete.png">
  <p class="caption">The latest iteration of our palette has two tones for each primary color. This gives us the flexibility to combine the two tones when layering benefits a composition, and also lets us choose a light or dark version of a color based on subject we designing for.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/extended.png">
  <p class="caption">After the initial palette was created, we began to work with illustrators and content curators, so the need for a more extensive palette emerged.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/color.png">
  <p class="caption">As part of a larger system of materials for the studio, I maintained a small color site that helped coworkers apply color to their work.</p>

  <p>Another aspect of our color palette that I worked on was Night mode. Night mode is one of the most-requested features by people using Twitter, and a project I worked on during Hackweek focused on providing themes to people to choose from gave us a solid foundation to create Night mode from.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">All background colors are based on our primary blue hue, to prevent Night mode from feeling stark, and to tie it to our primary palette.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20examples.png">
  <p class="caption">Night mode is accessed on Android in our navigation drawer. Future plans include an automatic on/off setting based on current time of day.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20theming.png">
  <p class="caption">A sample of the Hackweek project I worked on called Prism. People could select from a set of dark and light themes, and the work provided the technical foundation for a Night mode.</p>

  <h1>Navigation</h1>
  <p>As the amount of features on Twitter expanded, a need for a team dedicated to navigation updates emerged. A coworker and I collaborated on our first navigation project, which focused on proposing different navigation structures to help leadership evaluate how to add new features.

  <p>All explorations throughout this project were kept low in fidelity to focus on the structure we were changing, and to keep the process open to ideas from teams impacted by any navigation change.</p>

  <p>The initial work resulted in the company deciding to consolidate several teams to work on content discovery together.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%201.png">
  <p class="caption">An exploration that proposes a single space to discover people and content.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We also explored ways to consolidate activity directed towards a person. This example consolidates the direct message inbox with notifications.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%203.png">
  <p class="caption">This example consolidated all of our features into three destinations. The goal was to distinguish content that is highly personal (profiles and settings) from more public content, like the Timeline and search.</p>

  <p>During this project, Jack Dorsey challenged us to imagine a Twitter experience that was centered around the Timeline with no other distractions. A coworker and myself were excited about the prospect of a less complicated user experience, so we briefly explored different ways to simplify our experience.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%201.png">
  <p class="caption">We explored many examples like these, that reduced the perceived footprint of our navigation, to make more room for content.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We also explored how to make Twitter feel less complicated by making experiences that surround the Timeline feel less permanent and ancillary.</p>

  <h1>Dash</h1>
  <p>Originally a Hackweek project, Dash is now a funded effort to create a space for secondary navigation related to personalization.</p>

  <p>On both iOS and web there is not a space for settings, Night mode, account switching, and other user-related customization.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash.png">
  <p class="caption">The drawer opens either by tapping on your avatar in our tab bar, or by edge swiping left anywhere within the app.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">Because Night mode was a big reason to create a space for personalization, I also explored a palette for the drawer that was based on the time of day.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied.png">
  <p class="caption">The morning and afternoon colors for the drawer.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied%202.png">
  <p class="caption">The evening colors for the drawer.</p>

  <h1>Conversations</h1>
  <p>Being able to understand a lengthy conversation on Twitter is currently very difficult. We do not have a discoverable destination to view replies, and the structure of Tweets is so rigid that we do not distinguish replies from the Tweets they are in reply to.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/conversations%20view%20bottom%20to%20top.png">
  <p class="caption">An exploration of a dedicated place to view replies to a Tweet where we start at the bottom to show the most recent replies.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/conversations%20view%20immersive.png">
  <p class="caption">Another exploration of a conversation view that makes media a more prominent part of a thread. The goal was to make all replies feel related to the original Tweet.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/conversations%20view.png">
  <p class="caption">The most recent direction for a conversation view. Tapping Elon musk&rsquo;s Tweet reveals the larger conversation. The media and avatar from the original Tweet persist in the header to help set the tone of the conversation.</p>
