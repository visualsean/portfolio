  <h1>Bluebird</h1>
  <p>The Bluebird design language project completely changed my experience at Twitter.</p>

  <p>Designer leadership knew I had some free time, and challenged me to think critically about how Twitter should look and feel.</p>

  <p>I collaborated with my Director on writing design principles, and created many examples that were paired with our writing.</p>

  <p>The results of the project were indirect but significant: members of the larger design team incorporated many ideas from the project into their work, and the project continues to challenge us to push the design language of Twitter forward.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%201.png">
  <p class="caption">I explored different ways to reduce the prominence of our navigation, and larger footprints for text and media.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We reserved the use of color for important moments, such as messaging and actionable parts of the interface.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/seamful%203.png">
  <p class="caption">An example of user-defined color. Providing new ways for people on Twitter to express themselves in public continues to excite me.</p>

  <h1>Color</h1>
  <p>One practical project that emerged from the Bluebird design language work was updating our color palette.</p>

  <p>After exploring ways to improve Twitter visually, we realized that updates to our palette were easy to ship and would immediately impact how the product felt.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/primary%20palete.png">
  <p class="caption">The latest iteration of our palette has two tones for each primary color. This gives us the flexibility to combine the two tones when layering benefits an experience, and also lets us choose a light or dark version of a color based on subject we are designing for.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/extended.png">
  <p class="caption">After the palette was created, I began to work with illustrators and curators, so an expanded palette was necessary.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/color.png">
  <p class="caption">As part of a larger system of resources, I maintained a small site that helped coworkers apply color.</p>

  <p>Another aspect of our color palette that I worked on was night mode. Night mode was a highly requested feature on Twitter, and a theming project I worked on during Hackweek gave us a solid foundation to create it from.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">All background colors are based on our primary blue hue, to prevent night mode from feeling stark, and to tie it to our existing palette.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20examples.png">
  <p class="caption">Night mode is accessible on Android by opening our navigation drawer. Future plans include an auto on/off time of day setting.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/night%20mode%20theming.png">
  <p class="caption">A sample from a Hackweek project I worked on called Prism, which was a set of dark and light themes. The work provided a foundation for night mode.</p>

  <h1>Navigation</h1>
  <p>As the amount of features on Twitter increased, a need for a navigation project emerged. A coworker and I collaborated on a project focused on proposing different navigation structures to help leadership evaluate how to add new features.

  <p>All design work during this project was kept low-fidelity to focus on structure changes, and to keep the process open to ideas from teams potentially impacted.</p>

  <p>The work resulted in the company deciding to consolidate several teams to work on content discovery together.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%201.png">
  <p class="caption">A navigation structure with one unified place to find both people and content.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%202.png">
  <p class="caption">We explored ways to unify activity directed towards a person.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/bb%20nav%203.png">
  <p class="caption">This example consolidated all of our features into three destinations. The goal was to distinguish content that is highly personal (profiles and settings) from more public content, like the Timeline and search.</p>

  <p>During this project, Jack Dorsey encouraged us to think about how to further simplify our interface, to better emphasize the importance of Tweets.</p>  

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%201.png">
  <p class="caption">We explored many examples like these, that reduced the footprint of our navigation, to make more room for content.</p>    

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/one%20tab%202.jpg">
  <p class="caption">We also explored how to make Twitter feel less complicated by making areas that surround the Timeline feel more temporary.</p>

  <h1>Dash</h1>
  <p>Originally a Hackweek project, Dash is now a funded effort to create a space for navigation related to personalization.</p>

  <p>I designed an easy to access space for night mode, account switching, settings, and user profile controls.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash.png">
  <p class="caption">The drawer opens either by tapping on your avatar in our tab bar, or by edge swiping left anywhere within Twitter.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette.png">
  <p class="caption">Because the space is for personal content, I explored a color palette based on a person&#8217;s time of day.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied.png">
  <p class="caption">The morning and afternoon colors for the drawer.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/dash%20time%20of%20day%20palette%20applied%202.png">
  <p class="caption">The evening colors for the drawer.</p>

  <p class="caption">Posters from Hackweek. Each poster represents a time of day.</p>

  <h1>Conversations</h1>
  <p>Being able to understand a conversation on Twitter is very difficult. We do not have a discoverable destination to see replies, and do not distinguish replies from the Tweets they are in reply to.</p>

  <img class="sample" src="assets/work/conversations%20view%20bottom%20to%20top.jpg">
  <p class="caption">An exploration of a hub for replies to a Tweet, where you enter the conversation at the bottom, to see the most recent replies.</p>
